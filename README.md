# Toponymic Time Capsule: Mapping Britain's Linguistic Landscape

This project is a curated digital archive exploring the historical and linguistic evolution of a specific region of Britain through its place names (toponyms). As a geographer focused on the evolution of the British landscape, I understand that the map is not just a record of physical features, but a palimpsest of human history. The names of our towns, rivers, and hills are linguistic fossils, revealing the footprints of Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, and Normans.

The region chosen for this study is **the Danelaw**, the historical region of England under Danish law during the Viking Age (9th–11th centuries). This area, covering much of eastern and northern England, is particularly rich in Norse-derived place names. By examining toponyms within this region, we can trace the settlement patterns, language, and cultural imprint of the Vikings on the landscape. This archive aims to make this invisible layer of history visible, providing a resource for understanding how language, history, and human settlement are physically embedded in the modern landscape.
